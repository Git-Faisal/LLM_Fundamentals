# LLM Research Reference Page - Development Log

## Project Overview
Created a comprehensive LLM research reference page with a VS Code dark theme aesthetic, featuring terminology tables, architecture explanations, and interactive elements.

## Files Created
- `LLM_Research_Reference_Page.html` (Original - 106KB)
- `LLM_Research_Reference_Page_BACKUP.html` (Backup copy)
- `LLM_Research_Reference_Page_Dynamic.html` (New dynamic version - 23KB)
- `llm_terminology_data.json` (Extracted data - 63KB)

## Major Development Phases

### Phase 1: Initial Setup & Theme
- **Black Background**: Changed entire page to pure black (#000000)
- **VS Code Theme**: Applied consistent color scheme throughout
  - `#BD9178` - Class names, section headers, main title
  - `#2575D5` - Keywords, operators, navigation links (now main title)
  - `#CEBA7E` - Function names, term names
  - `#E3D617` - Brackets, operators, hover states
  - `#BDCEA9` - Comments, categories
  - `#ffffff` - Body text, definitions

### Phase 2: Table Enhancement
- **Added Learning Terms**:
  - MoE (Mixture of Experts) → Section 6 (Model Architecture)
  - Supervised/Unsupervised/Self-supervised/Semi-supervised Learning → Section 2 (How Learning Works)
  - Transfer Learning → Section 9 (Advanced Techniques)
- **Fixed Color Consistency**: Resolved term name colors across all sections
- **Link Styling**: Updated all links to use VS Code blue (#2575D5) with yellow hover (#E3D617)

### Phase 3: Architecture Code Style
- **Transformer Architecture**: Redesigned as VS Code-style code block
- **Natural Language as Code**: Written like Python with proper syntax highlighting
- **Detailed Comments**: Added comprehensive explanations for each formula step
- **Examples**:
  ```python
  # Step 1: Convert text to tokens
  tokens = tokenize(input_sequence)  # "Hello world" → [101, 7592, 2088]
  # Split text into subword pieces and map to unique IDs the model recognizes
  ```

### Phase 4: Data Extraction & Dynamic Loading
- **Problem**: Original file became 2000+ lines, difficult to maintain
- **Solution**: Extracted table data to JSON, created dynamic loading system
- **Benefits**:
  - Easy term updates via JSON editing
  - Cleaner HTML structure
  - Maintained all functionality and styling
  - Reduced main HTML file size by 78%

### Phase 5: Responsive Design & Layout
- **Table Headers**: Fixed to match actual column structure (Section, Term, Technical, Layman, Type)
- **Column Widths**: Implemented responsive design
  - Fixed: Section (200px), Term (180px), Type & Reference (280px)
  - Dynamic: Technical Definition and Layman Explanation (equal split)
  - Minimum widths for readability
- **Mobile Responsive**: Horizontal scrolling for small screens
- **Container Width**: Increased max-width to 1600px for better space utilization

### Phase 6: Final Polish
- **Author Attribution**: Added "by Faisal Alkhorayef" in yellow italic
- **Title Color**: Changed to blue (#2575D5) to match navigation
- **Formula Column**: Expanded to 280px to prevent wrapping of complex formulas

### Phase 7: Interactive Architecture Diagrams ⭐
- **Complete Redesign**: Transformed all architecture sections into interactive two-column layouts
- **Code-to-Diagram Mapping**: Hover over diagram blocks highlights corresponding code sections
- **Visual Flow**: Added arrows between all diagram blocks showing processing flow
- **VS Code Integration**: Consistent syntax highlighting throughout all architectures
- **Responsive Design**: Layouts stack vertically on smaller screens (<1200px)
- **Centered Text**: All diagram block text properly centered for professional appearance

#### Implemented Architectures:
1. **Transformer** - Multi-head attention with parallel processing (enhanced)
2. **RNN** - Sequential processing with memory states (restored)
3. **CNN** - Local pattern detection with convolutional filters (restored)
4. **LSTM** - Gated memory with forget/input/output gates (restored)
5. **Mamba (State-Space)** - Selective state spaces for long sequences (new)
6. **GNN** - Message passing on graph structures (new)
7. **GAT** - Graph attention networks with learnable edge weights (new)

#### Interactive Features:
- **Hover Effects**: Diagram blocks trigger code highlighting with smooth transitions
- **Code Dimming**: Non-relevant code sections fade to 30% opacity for focus
- **Step-by-Step Flow**: Clear visual progression through each architecture
- **Touch-Ready**: Basic responsive design for mobile devices

    const codeSteps = document.querySelectorAll('.code-step');

    diagramBlocks.forEach(block => {
        block.addEventListener('mouseenter', () => {
            // Dim all code sections
            codeSteps.forEach(step => step.classList.add('dimmed'));
